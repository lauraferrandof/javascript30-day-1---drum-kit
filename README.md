# Wes Bos' JavaScript30 Day 1 challenge - Drum-kit

Hey there!

This is my version of the first challenge of [Wes Bos' JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course. It's a project where the user can press some keyboards and get drum kit sound effects.

Some of the new things I learned:

- The HTML `<audio>` element, which made me research about some of its properties and methods.

- How to use the `data-` attribute, and how useful it is.

- The `transitionend` event, how it can be used to manipulate CSS transitions with JavaScript, and some of its properties.

Even though I followed closely Bos' tutorial, I also made some personal modifications according to my coding style.

I'm sure there's a lot of improvement to be made, so please don't hesitate to open an issue or send a PR! :)

Enjoy!!
